# Medmain React UI Kit

React shared components used by Medmain web applications.

This repository is split into 2 parts:

- [package](https://github.com/medmain/react-ui-kit/tree/master/package): the `@medmain/react-ui-kit` package, imported by Medmain applications
- [playground](https://github.com/medmain/react-ui-kit/tree/master/playground): a standalone web application, made with [Docz](https://docz.site/), to see the components in action and provide documentation.
